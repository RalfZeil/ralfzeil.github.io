## Tool Development

**Date:** April 2, 2024

### Context
This is a project made for the subject _Tool Development_.

For this project, I made a tool to support a creative process.  
The requirements for the school project were:
- Needs to support a creative process.
- Has saving and loading features.

### The Project
I created a tool that can be used to create dialogues for games. The tool is made in **C++** and uses the **IMGui** and **GLFW** libraries to create a user interface.  
The tool supports saving and loading to **XML format**. It is designed for game designers to create dialogues or text logs for games.  
It allows you to easily add attributes to the text and change the style of the text with simple button presses.

### What I learned
This was my first time using **IMGui** with **GLFW**.  
Using only the bare minimum to create a tool was quite hard, especially since I had to create my own window management.  
In the end, I am quite proud of my project since I challenged myself by using **C++** for the sake of learning more about it.
