### Context
This is a project made for the subject _Project Hybrid_.  
Project Hybrid focuses on games that combine digital and physical elements.  
In this project, our team created a game controlled by a dancepad. Players navigate through an old arcade and try to escape from a monster that's constantly chasing them. The game is displayed on a monitor, and the dancepad is connected to a computer.
