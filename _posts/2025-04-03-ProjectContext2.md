### Context
This is a project made for the subject _Project Context II_.  
Project Context II focuses on games that showcase or teach important aspects of sustainability.  
For this project, our team created a deck-building city manager. Players must manage a city and ensure its sustainability by integrating human urbanization with nature.

### Importance
For our project, we chose to highlight the importance of human and nature crossings.  
With the help of a University of Utrecht student specializing in modern sustainability, we created this game inspired by the patch corridor matrix.  
The patch corridor matrix connects different nature reserves, allowing animals and plants to travel between them, increasing their chances of survival and healthy spreading.

### My Role
In this project, I acted as the developer. I was responsible for implementing the game and the systems required for it to function.  
I also contributed to the game's design and mechanics.
