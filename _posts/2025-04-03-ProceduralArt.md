### Context
This is a project made for the subject _Procedural Art_.  
The subject focuses on developing interactive, procedurally calculated forms of art using any technique, as long as it's procedural and interactive.

### The Project
For this project, I created a wolf that has trouble standing straight.  
I used procedural animations with physics to simulate a funky simulation.  
Players can push the wolf around and see how it tries to stay upright.

### Tech/Systems Used
For this project, I created an IK (inverse kinematics) solver to calculate where the wolf must place its feet.
